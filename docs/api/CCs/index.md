# Command Classes API

The **Command Classes API** provides a high-to-mid level entrypoint which allows you to use most CC commands that are implemented in Z-Wave JS. This API can be accessed for each node or endpoint using the [`commandClasses` property](api/endpoint.md#commandClasses).

> [!NOTE] Some commands are meant to be used together and that there may be better high-level APIs exposed elsewhere to achieve certain tasks (e.g. for firmware updates).
